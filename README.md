Project Title: Coffee Sales Dashboard

Project Overview:
Developed an interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard using Microsoft Excel (Power Query & PivotTables) to visualize and analyze coffee sales data across different regions, time periods, and customer segments.

Key Features & Highlights:
Interactive Date Filter:
Used slicer filters for dynamic selection of order dates across months and years (2019–2022).
Enabled time-based trend analysis of sales using Excel’s Timeline Slicer.

Dynamic Filtering Options:

Implemented slicers for:
Coffee Size (0.2, 0.5, 1, 2.5 liters)
Roast Type (Dark, Medium, Large)
Loyalty Card Status (Yes/No)
Used pivot table filters to dynamically update visuals based on selections.

Total Sales by Country: Horizontal bar chart showing regional performance, highlighting the United States as the top market.

Data Analysis Techniques:
Used PivotTables for data aggregation (SUM of sales, customer-wise and country-wise breakdown).
Applied Power Query (Get & Transform) for initial data cleaning and formatting before visualization.

Design & Formatting:
Designed with a dark theme and high-contrast color palette for clarity and aesthetics.
Added data labels and tooltips for ease of interpretation.
Customized chart elements (axis titles, legends) for better readability.

Tools & Functions Used:
Excel Tools: PivotTables, PivotCharts, Slicers, Power Query.

Functions: SUM, SORT, FILTER, conditional formatting, and dynamic range selection.
